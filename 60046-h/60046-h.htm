<p class='c004'><em class='gesperrt'>HEREIN THE FORTUNATE
READERS WILL FIND
THE HAPPY CONJUNCTION</em>
of two very brilliant young people, whose literary
and artistic talents fit like the proverbial glove, or
the musical and lyrical alliance of those immortals,
Gilbert and Sullivan.</p>

<p class='c005'>Never were epigrams more worthily illustrated,
or more worthy of illustration. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">joie de vivre</span></i>,
the humour and the human observation which run
through this little volume, will I am sure make a
great appeal to the public possessing or admiring
those qualities.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am proud to think that I was responsible for
the journalistic débuts of both authors, whose work
enriched the pages of <cite>The Tatler</cite> for some years, and
that I have been honoured in being asked to write
an introduction to their first collective effort.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c004'><em class='gesperrt'>THE LOOKING-GLASS</em> reveals
us as we are to ourselves; the Wine-glass
reveals us as we are to others.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF A MAN</em> puts a woman on a pedestal
someone else will help her down.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NO MAN</em> gets what he wants, though
some may get what they have wanted.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE REASON</em> that a love affair so
seldom ends happily is that one of the
lovers is generally unwilling for it to end at all.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'>
<em class='gesperrt'>NO ONE</em> agrees with other people’s
opinions, they merely agree with their
own opinions expressed by somebody else.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT IS</em> a poor doctor who cannot prescribe
an expensive cure for a rich patient.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>A WOMAN</em> alone is not necessarily a
temptation, if she were a temptation she
would probably not be alone.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SOME</em> people succeed in preserving a
youthful appearance, but they show their
age in their opinions.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'>
<em class='gesperrt'>IF YOU GIVE</em> a woman an opportunity,
she will take everything else that
she wants.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>YOU ARE</em> much nearer success when you
are deplored than when you are ignored.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SO MANY</em> young women have glibly
promised their lovers that they would
‘never change’ and have been unrecognisable
ten years later.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>TO A WOMAN</em> women are a sex and
men an individual.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'>
<em class='gesperrt'>A WOMAN</em> likes to know what the man
she loves was like when he was a little boy;
but a man would rather know what the woman
he loves will be like when she is an old woman.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT IS PROBABLE</em> that if a woman
cannot see the point of her husband’s jokes
she will see very little indeed of him.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>A WOMAN</em> may have a small mouth and
yet be able to open it very wide.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>A GIRL WHO</em> spends her youth learning
philosophy will almost certainly need
it when her youth is spent.</p>

<em class='gesperrt'>ONE MAN’S</em> love is often only the
bait with which another man is caught.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SOME PEOPLE</em> contrive to make their
‘silent suffering’ simply deafening.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ONE CAN</em> forgive a person lying about
one and possibly disprove them, but it is
unforgiveable if they tell the truth; that is
taking a mean advantage.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WOMEN</em> have been the same through
all the ages: the only difference between
a girl and her mother is their feeling for her
father.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'>
<em class='gesperrt'>IT IS</em> difficult for a man to understand
that a woman who would go through hell
for love of him is capable of leaving him because
he clears his throat or uses a toothpick.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOTHING</em> unites people like a common
sorrow, except, perhaps, a vulgar joke.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF A PRETTY</em> back view won’t let you
catch it up it has probably got a horrible
face.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS SOON</em> as a woman has put a man in

<em class='gesperrt'>THE ONLY</em> blows Fate seems to deal
some people are slaps on the back.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>A WOMAN’S</em> clothes should be like an
epigram, an adequate expression of an
idea without a superfluous—syllable.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SOME MEN</em> borrow a fiver and behave
for ever after as if the only thing they owed
you was a grudge.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>A WOMAN IS</em> not really adequately

<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'>
<em class='gesperrt'>IT IS</em> inexplicable, but undeniable, that a
man often prefers the woman he has to
make excuses for to the woman he has to make
excuses to.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHAT</em> a woman costs and what she is
worth are two entirely different things.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AMBITIONS</em> vary: Men may want to
do well, women may want to look well,
but the old only want to sleep well.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>A WOMAN</em> cares most for a man when
their love affair is over, a man cares most
for a woman before their love affair has begun.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'>
<em class='gesperrt'>EVERYONE</em> likes to be run after, but
the difference between men and women
is that men do not want to be caught and
women do.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>A WOMAN</em> who can bear to hear her
husband praise another woman is either
different to other wives or indifferent to her
husband.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>A MAN’S</em> ‘for ever’ is just about as long
as a woman’s ‘five minutes.’</p>

love letter, but only a fool would do it.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ODDLY</em> enough the impression made by
the possession of several different names
is not nearly so favourable as the impression
made by the possession of several different
addresses.</p>

how to begin and when to stop.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MANY A MAN</em> has ended by running
